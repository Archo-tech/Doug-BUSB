#- Introduction -
	Welcome to The _Illustrious_ "Doug 2.0" Bootable USB program! This device
	is used to aboloish certain unwanted restrictions on certain laptops by
	deleting all the garbage put on it, and replacing that with something more
	usable, coincidentally of the same make and model as the school provided laptops
	(But of course you shouldn't use the Doug2.0 USB on them, as that would be
	against the rules, rules that you should NEVER EVER, EVER BREAK! Definitely
	don't use this on a school laptop...)
 
	Provided within The Official "Doug 2.0" Bootable USB Program USB, you'll find
	the proper resources to DELETE WINDOWS,faithfully provided "Doug LLC". Contact
	information can be found at the bottom of this page and the licensing
	agreement. For any references to the license, refer to "license.txt" provided
	within the USB.

__####	THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO DELETE EVERYTHING ON YOUR COMPUTER, PLEASE KEEP####___
__####	THIS IN MIND MOVING FORWARD. ANY DAMAGE DONE, THAT IS NOT A DIRECT RESULT OF####__
__####	FOLLOWING THE PROVIDED INSTRUCTIONS IS NOT OUR RESPONSIBILITY.####__


- Installation -

	I recommend downloading these instructions or otherwise have
	them available on another device, before we get into the
	long-winded boring stuff.

	Step 1.)
	In order to make way for our new and improved operating system,
	we've got to get rid of the old one. Plug in the "Doug 2.0" USB
        and log out. After that, hold down SHIFT while you click RESTART
	under POWER OPTIONS. After this point the computer should begin
	to restart, and load onto the BIOS screen. The BIOS screen is blue
	with a bunch of big buttons that do a few things we aren't
	interested in.

	Step 2.)
	The next step has multiple ways that you can accompolish the same
	exact thing, it does not matter which one you wind up using, so
	long as one works. If neither work, email me at archotech@mail.com

		METHOD A: With the USB plugged in, click "Boot from
		Device" and select "HDD". If HDD does not work(The screen
		stays black then restarts), and all other options have been
		exhausted, attempt the other options before switching to
		Method B.

		METHOD B: Within the BIOS menu, click advanced and navigate
		to the "Boot" or "Boot Options" section. Look for the
		"Boot Order" or "Boot Sequence" setting. Change the boot
		order to prioritize the USB drive. Save the changes and
		exit the BIOS. Your computer should now boot from the
		"Doug 2.0" USB.
		
-		METHOD C: If method A and B fail, then attempt the following:
		Exit the BIOS menu, allowing the computer to restart. Restart
		your computer once more, as the Lenovo logo appears, press
		F2 or F12 to enter One-Time boot mode. If successful, this
		should bring up a list of available boot devices. Navigate
		to and select the "Doug 2.0" USB drive from the list and
		press Enter (It may be listed as "E-Drive", USB, or USB HDD,
		so keep an eye out).
		Important Note: This method is the quickest way to boot from
		the USB drive without changing your computer's permanent
		boot settings. However, it may not work on all computers or
		laptops, so if you encounter any issues.

	Step 3.)
	Once your computer boots from the "Doug 2.0" USB, you'll be prompted
	to set-up a mildly customized Windows 11 operating system. MAKE SURE
	TO SELECT THE OPTION THAT FULLY ERASES THE SYSTEM, OTHERWISE ALL THE
	PROGRAMS AND RESTRICTIONS WILL REMAIN. This operating system is not
	endorsed or supported by your school or laptop manufacturer. Use it
	veeery responsibly and within legal and ethical boundaries
	(Which we do fully entrust in you to determine what "ethical" may
	truly means to you).

	Step 4.)
	This step is a collection of things that aren't quite necessary,
	but I highly recommend doing them anyways, just for the sake of
	not having the "primary owner" reset the laptop.

		1.) Set the background of your new machine to
		"MainBackground.png" provided in the "BonusSteps" folder.

		2.)  Set the lockscreenbackground of your new machine to
		"LockBackground.png" provided in the "BonusSteps" folder.
