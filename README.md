# Introduction

Welcome to The _Illustrious_ "Doug 2.0" Bootable USB program! This device is used to aboloish certain _unwanted_ restrictions on certain laptops by deleting all the garbage put on it, and replacing that with something more usable, coincidentally of the same make and model as the school provided laptops (But of course you shouldn't use the Doug2.0 USB on them, as that would be against the rules, rules that you should NEVER EVER, EVER BREAK! Definitely don't use this on a school laptop...) 

***ONLY USE THUS WITH THE EXPRESSED AND FULL INTENTION TO FULLY WIPE THESE LAPTOPS. IF YOU ***
